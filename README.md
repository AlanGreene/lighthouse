# lighthouse

A lightweight webhook handler to trigger Jenkins X Pipelines from webhooks from GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket Cloud / Server, GitLab, Gitea etc

Pudge, the webhook handler, is named after legendary Boston Red Sox catcher and Hall of Fame inductee Carlton "Pudge" Fisk, because it catches webhooks. However, unlike its namesake, it's blindingly fast.
